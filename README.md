# BossBar Timer
<br></br>
### This plugin is no longer maintained!
Some things may no longer work.

In addition to this I'd also like to add that at the time of programming this I had a very limited amount of knowledge in the Java programming language so the code is likely nowhere near as efficient as it could be and likely contains bugs.

## Plugin Functionality
Usually players must keep an eye on in-game chat in order to know how long it is until an event happens on a server (e.g. a restart). BossBar Timer aims to provide a better way to visualise this by instead utilising the BossBar in order to create a countdown timer.
Plugin features include, but are not limited to:
* Being able to change the colour of the BossBar to 1 of the 7 supported colours
* Being able to set the title of the BossBar
  * Bukkit colour codes are supported
  * Multiple words are supported
* Being able to set a custom duration
  * E.g. `1d 5h 20m 50s` = 1 day, 5 hours, 20 minutes and 50 seconds
